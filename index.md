# Home

Welcome to the homepage for Precisamento!

The main reason to be here is to browse the documentation for the various libraries and extensions that I've created. Ocassionally I'll make some blog posts and other content that will be hosted here as well.

Currently the site is still a work-in-progress, and content is being added at a steady pace. Currently it isn't particularly friendly to the eyes. If you have any suggestions, you can contact me using one of the links in the footer, or if you're feeling helpful, you can directly contribute to the website via it's [github](https://github.com/Precisamento/Precisamento.github.io) page.

Thanks for stopping by!
