# Taffy Script

This is the temporary download page for the TaffyScript programming language compiler. For more information, check out the [Github](https://github.com/mystborn/TaffyScript) page.

## Installation
Currently the only type of installation is a standalone exe, so just unpack the zip file wherever you'd like the compiler to be installed and it will be ready to use.

## Downloads

Windows:

Latest: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/TaffyScriptReleases/TaffyScript1.1.0.zip" download>TaffyScript1.1.0</a>

MacOS/\*nix:

Currently TaffyScript is Windows only. This may not always hold true, so make sure to keep updated if you're interested in the project. Unfortunately some of the technology that is relied heavily upon is also Windows only, so it might take awhile.
